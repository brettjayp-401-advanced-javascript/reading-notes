## Discussion
### 1. What makes an interface useful?
- An interface is made useful by simplifying use and reducing the amount of learning needed to integrate a technology.

### 2. Why is middleware called middleware?
- It seems to me that it's called middleware because it is asynchronous code that runs between your code and the database.

### 3. Fundamentally, what does it mean to have a mock of something? Why is this useful?
- A non-production copy or imitation of a working product (DB in this case). Very useful in development on a live product because the present risks when working with data could be terrible.

### 4. What does it mean to have a mock database?
- To have an imitation or copy of the production/live database, where changes would not affect the production/live database.
