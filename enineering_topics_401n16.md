### Solving Problems

- Measure twice, cut once.
- During interviews, resist urge to jump straight into code.
- Time management.
- Don't try to over solve on the first iteration. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
    - Read the problem twice
    - Solve manually with 3 sets of simple data
    - Optimize the manual steps
    - Write them as comments or pseudo-code
    - Replace w/ real code
    - Optimize code
- Steps 1-3 should take 70% of the time

### Act like you make $1000/hr

- Most people value their time well below its worth.
- Visualize, if you made $1k/hr:
    - what is life like
    - who would you ignore
    - what problems are meaningless
    - what would/wouldn't you be doing
