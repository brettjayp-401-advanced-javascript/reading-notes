## Discussion
### 1. What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?
* JavaScript is more flexible, allowing you to change data types later if desired.

### 2. What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?
* Can make testing more difficult.

### 3. Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?
* Probably not, the parameters of a function probably should not be changed when the function returns. By doing so, you would not be able to expect the same results when you run the function again. But if you have a need for it, why not.

### 4. Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?
* Booleans are another data type. It must be either value.
